# WebRTC Demo

This repo contains a simple voice chatbot over the phone.

This uses the WebTerminalProtocol (WTP) API to intercept phone calls to a given number as described in
https://developer.cisco.com/docs/mobility-services/how-to-make-and-receive-webrtc-calls/

This used the public Python SDK hosted at https://buf.build/wgtwo/wgtwoapis/docs/main:wgtwo.webterminal.v0.

The demo application can be found in the `voicebot` directory.
